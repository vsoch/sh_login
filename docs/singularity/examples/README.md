# Examples
Both of these need to be tested and redone when we can have a proper startscript
to define the network space (with isolation of network).

 - [jupyter notebook (sh_login)](sh_notebook): a notebook behind sh_login, won't work until we have an isolated network space.
 - [notebook](notebook): Just standard notebook, will work because we don't need sh_login.
 - [hello world](helloworld): also doesn't work until we have isolation.
